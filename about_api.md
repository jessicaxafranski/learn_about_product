# What's the API?


I was thinking about how I can help people that work with digital products or until people are working in other related areas with the creation of the same (business,ux..), 
showing concepts that could appear in our daily lives and for that, I started creating a playlist : [Product Podcas's](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6KQahjazUioDa67reVJHhC?si=37823575f33e4ec4)


Well, one topic that is very popular  in the area, are technical products, that are not visible for the users. And we  talk about APIâ€™s (Application Programming Interface),
that in a simple way is a set of services that **doesnâ€™t have a visual interface but that has communication and connection with other applications.** 


Looking  for this information and having a simplified understanding about the topic, I started listening to some podcasts that show examples of people who work directly with this
kind of product to see an applicable view of the same.

And in my little list are:


## Women in Product: #65 Technical Products

This epi has a simple approach about the construction of technical products, like how to orchestrate products, define who people use the product, how to break tasks, describe requirements and documentation.

## Product Guruâ€™s: #99 Vagner Fiuza - the importance about API

This epi demonstrates easily how to understand APIâ€™s, showing some business metrics that people from product realized, indicating how to measure and analyze the construction of an API product.

### And Which are the benefits of using an API?ðŸ”¥

- Reduction of time to search data; 
- Developers have facility to develop.
- Saving time.

We canâ€™t forget who product people, when (we are) using an API service inside of the workflow user (for example, check if one CPF is validate in the recite (maybe I need to change the example), 
always should be considering the time of answering, and this product are consulting 2 or more different APIâ€™S, can impact the way that the informations will show.
