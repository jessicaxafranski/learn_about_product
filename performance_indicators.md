and efficiency, so we need to analyze the performance indicators. It's necessary to see the irrelevances, algorism.

- Costumers 
- Organization

**Types of indicators**
- Satisfaction Index
- Approval or Disapproval Index regarding my service performance

It is necessary to measure the start, middle and end of the process to determine if the performance was as expected. The indicators must align with the process. Measuring aspects that do not add value will make the indicator irrelevant to the process. If we do not understand the health of each of our processes, it will be difficult to understand the overall company, implement new strategies, deal with variability, meet goals, and maintain efficiency. Without this understanding, it will be hard to know where to improve the process. The indicators provide a comprehensive snapshot of the company's health, identifying the main bottlenecks. If we do not understand, we will not know where to improve in the process.

## Define your goals

- What is my business objective? It's a high-level aim.
- What is my business goal? The goal is quantifiable, I can measure it. I want to reach a specific target.
- What are my indicators? These are the numbers that will tell me if I have achieved my goal

|Objective | Goal | Deadline for delivery|
|----------|------|---------|
| Increase the sales| Increse the sales in 10%| 6 months|

It is imperative that these three elements always remain connected. If I don't determine my objective and my goals, any result we you consider good
If I don't set the deadline don't make sense, I have the date to reach the goal.
The indicators show a picture of our results.
