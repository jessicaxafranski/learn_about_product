## Product Building Roadmap

This text is based on Linkedin Course: *Product Management, Build a Product Roadmap*

The course started to talk about who are important people to build a roadmap in a company.
It's necessary always to stay aligned with the company goals to make decisions.

### Who are that people?
Customers, Customer-facing groups, Investors, board, sponsors, Architects, engineers, designers, and Human resources 

## What are Milestones?

A roadmap milestone is a date signaling an event or deadline that the product manager wants the team to be aware of. These milestones might relate directly to the product's progressâ€”such as a release date. They might also represent a date that the team needs to keep in mind as they work on the product.

It's important to think about the level of granularity (but is not mean that should be backlog tasks)
