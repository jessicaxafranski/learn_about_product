## Product Building Roadmap

This text is based on Linkedin Course: *Product Management, Build a Product Roadmap*

The course started to talk about who are important people to build a roadmap in a company.
It's necessary always to be aligned with the company goals to make decisions.

### Who are that people?
Customers, Customer-facing groups, Investors, board, sponsors, Architects, engineers, designers, and Human resources 

## What are Milestones?

A roadmap milestone is a date signaling an event or deadline that the product manager wants the team to be aware of. These milestones might relate directly to the product's progress‚Äîsuch as a release date. They might also represent a date that the team needs to keep in mind as they work on the product.


## How Can I start a value milestone?

You need to understand the impactfull in diffents ways to build a good Stratey for your milestone.

1) Start with your own reserach and thinking
2) Reready your product strategy
3) Research the market and your target customers
4) Try to imagine major product changes.

 Miles should be major products changes, which will take significant amounts of reserach, design and development work. These is the steps to build one:
 
 1) Record the strategic objective it supports.
 2) The goal is to reduce your cost of service delivery 
 3) We (PM) don't know long the squad team would take to build
 4) Put the Milestone in rough priority order

<pre><code>It's important to think about the level of granularity (but is not mean that should be backlog tasks).</code></pre>

After that, you should ask for the stakeholders a feedback and sense of priority. Create a sequence of sequence of milestone  and together will implement your product strategy  (Stakeholder and Product implements together the strategy)

## Estimate levels of effort

It‚Äôs important to put dates on the roadmaps and for that it‚Äôs necessary to have changes with the product development leader on this. A lot of people don't consider the development capacity team, is not obvious, because the time are spent time with, bug fixing, product maintence and engineering driven projects. However, we need to understand how much time is spent on these items.

Seeing the example:

**First step: Estimate the development capacity of your team**

- 25% bug fixing
- 20% product maiintenance
- 20% engineering
- 35% capacity for development

**Second step: Estimate the development time for each milestone**

|Milestone| Strategic Objective | Summary | Source | Time |
|---------|---------------------|---------|-------|-------|
|||||


If my milestone requires 20 developer weeks and my time has five developers weeks of capacity for new feature development every week, we can assume that the milestone will be release in four weeks.

- Identify high-piority milestones that can be completed together
- Identify lower priority milestones for the second time period

You need to figure out the capacity and effort required of each team separately (BACK and Front)

- Does it implement your product strategy?
- Is it feasible from a development resource perspective?

If the answers for these questions are yes.  you have a straw man and can share your time üòÅ


**Third step**

Now it's time to align with everybody.

1) Sequence your Milestones;
2) Schedule milestones



Be continuous....:P
