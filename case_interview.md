 # Objetive 

When participating in a case interview, it is essential to think quickly and creatively. The key focus should be on delivering value, understanding the product, and prioritizing the customer. In case interviews for consultants, you will typically be asked to analyze data provided during the session to solve a problem. In contrast, Product Manager (PM) interviews often require you to rely more on your instincts and experience to propose solutions.

# **What Interviewers Look For**

- **Structure a Problem**  
  Even with open-ended questions, it’s essential to break the problem into components. Find a way to approach the problem in a structured and logical manner.

- **Show Strong Instincts**  
  We rarely have access to all the data we’d like. A good PM should be able to make sound business decisions, even in the absence of exhaustive data.

- **Drive, Not Ride**  
  Show that you are driving the interview forward. Discuss the benefits and trade-offs, considering both short-term and long-term impacts.

> **Important:** Think through the problem, make the best decision you can, and explain your reasoning clearly.
