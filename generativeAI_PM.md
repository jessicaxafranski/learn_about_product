# GENERATIVE AI FOR PRODUCT MANAGERS - Course LinkedIn

All technological sectors are growing quickly. As a Product Manager, I often see posts on LinkedIn where people argue about the future of our profession and how AI might replace us. 
I don't completely disagree with these points, but people tend to forget that humanity adapts, and as IT professionals, we need to evolve with our environment.
If we look back 20 years, we had roles that primarily involved typing, which are no longer necessary today.
As someone who loves to learn and discover, I try to zoom out from individual perspectives and understand the reasons behind these concerns. 
I aim to address all my doubts as a professional and do a mindmap to find a better solution for my future.

- Why am I afraid?
- Could AI replace me?
- What's the difference between AI and me?
- How can I improve my day with AI's help?

By Answering these questions, I understood what I needed to improve and learn, and I started looking for courses that could help me. 
I discovered a LinkedIn course that answered all my questions.

## Questions to consider

- What is your role in this?
- Is this for a new product or for enhancing an existing product?
- Is there a specific goal, like increasing a particular metric?
- Are there any hard restrictions, like regulations, hardware, software, or human resources?

## Regarding the company and strategy

- How big is the company? What are its current offerings?
- How is the audience?
- What is the monetization strategy (if there is one)?
- What is the mission of the company (if there is one)?

## PRODUCT LIFECYCLE

What user personas would use [type of tech (sample: voice recognition) ] in an app and what use cases would they use it? Create in prioritized list of user personas based on reach. I am going to create an app and will only launch it in [Country/State] in the beginning so make sure to that into account as well.
 
#### **Breakdown of the Formula**

- Type of Tech: Specify the technology you are focusing on (e.g., voice recognition).
- User Personas: Ask for specific user personas that would benefit from this technology.
- Use Cases: Inquire about the practical applications or scenarios in which these personas would use the technology.
- Prioritized List: Request a list ranked by reach or potential user base.
- Geographic Focus: Specify the country or state where the app will be launched to ensure relevance in the response.

**AI Sample:** What user personas would use voice recognition technology in a mobile app, and what use cases would they have? Create a prioritized list of user personas based on reach. I plan to launch the app only in [Country/State] initially, so consider that in your response.

**Deeper** - as a follow up to my question about voice recognition technology and user personas, let's dig deeper onto the first persona, commuters and drivers. What is their main pain point at the moment that voice recognition technology could solve?

## VALIDATING IDEA:

It's really important to gather feedback from real people. We also analyze market trends and user behaviors before spending a lot of money or effort on research.
