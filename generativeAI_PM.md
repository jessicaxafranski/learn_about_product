GENERATIVE AI FOR PRODUCT MANAGERS - Course Linkedin

All technological sectors are growing quickly. As a Product Manager, I often see posts on LinkedIn where people argue about the future of our profession and how AI might replace us. 
I don't completely disagree with these points, but people tend to forget that humanity adapts, and as IT professionals, we need to evolve with our environment.
If we look back 20 years, we had roles that primarily involved typing, which are no longer necessary today.
As someone who loves to learn and discover, I try to zoom out from individual perspectives and understand the reasons behind these concerns. 
I aim to address all my doubts as a professional and do a mindmap to find a better solution for my future.

- Why am I afraid?
- Could AI replace me?
- What's the difference between AI and me?
- How can I improve my day with AI's help?

By Answering these questions, I understood what I needed to improve and learn, and I started looking for courses that could help me. 
I discovered a LinkedIn course that answered all my questions.
